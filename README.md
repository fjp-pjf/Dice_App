# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple Dice app having two random dice generating different numbers each time we roll it.
Animation is applied through css-transform.
App is designed with stateful components.
Button is disabled while its rolling and until output is generated.
